### WatchList

An app for android which is based on the omdb api. It allows you to search this database through querying titles and furthermore
provides information on the specific movies. These movies can then be added to a watchlist which is also accesible. 
The watchlist can be emptyed as well which means you don't have to individually remove the movies.
When you first start the app you get asked for your name to futher personalize the app.

This app supports orientation changes as well.
